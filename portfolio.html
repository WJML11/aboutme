			<p class="paragraphs">I am a nineteen year old student currently in the process of figuring out what to do.  I have an interest in a lot of things, but really I do not think I will one day find myself doing "a lot of things." So...I am doing two things: Business and Design.  Practical and Abstract.  Harsh and Freedom.  I hope the last one gave you an idea of the "one thing" I hope to be doing.

			<p class="paragraphs">I am an aspiring designer, and I use the term very generally on purpose.  I love and appreciate all art as well and hope to one day proudly call myself an artist.  Also, I hope to one day influence someone with something I did or just have them come to me and let me know how that affected them. That would be fulfilling and I think if that is what I had to do during my life I would be happy with that. </p>
